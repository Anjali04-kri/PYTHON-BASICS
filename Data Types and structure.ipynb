    "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using a data structure known as a hash table. This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data through key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hash Function: When a key is added to a dictionary, Python computes its hash value using a built-in hash function. This hash value determines the index in the underlying array where the key-value pair will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Buckets: The dictionary maintains an array of buckets (also referred to as slots). Each bucket can hold a key-value pair. Initially, a dictionary starts with a fixed number of buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collision Resolution: Sometimes, different keys may produce the same hash value, leading to a collision. Python handles these collisions using a method called open addressing. This approach searches for the next available bucket to store the colliding key-value pair. \n",

    "## Resizing: To maintain performance, Python dictionaries automatically resize (typically doubling in size) when a certain load factor is exceeded. This process involves rehashing existing keys to fit into the new array size. \n",
    "data-structures-in-practice.com\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key-Value Storage: Each bucket stores the hash of the key, the key itself, and the associated value. This design ensures that even if two keys have the same hash value, they can be distinguished by comparing the actual keys.\n"
